Title:  World War II (WWII) Bombing Missions & Weather Analysis Database

General:  Achieving air superiority in combat was critical to the Allies success in World War II.  Assembling this database will support analysis to provide insights into the use of combat aircraft in all WWII theaters of combat.   Many insights that can be gleaned from this database include evaluating the effects of various weather conditions on:
	• Mission success and aircraft survivability
	• Mission altitude and time over target
	• Deployment of aircraft type and weapon type used
	• Type of targets selected
	• Number of aircraft deployed
